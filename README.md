# Ultrasound-image-classification-and-segmentation


__*Disclaimer*__: *This project do not pretend to do the work of a Doctor, this project will help the analysis for a Doctor.* ü©∫


## Purpose

This is not a *commercial software*. The main objective of this project is to build an opensource code for medical image analysis, in this case the model was trainned with breast cancer images. In the future more cancer images will be added to help identifying cancer in early stages.

We created via ML model a classification and segmentation model for breast ultrasound cancer. Cancer is a very hard disease that in some cases cannot be cured, but an early detection will help a lot of people. ‚ù§Ô∏è


## How the project was built?

We apply Convolutional networks with Tensorflow mainly (CNN).
